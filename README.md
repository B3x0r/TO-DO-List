# TO-DO-List
#### Description:
Simple To Do list created in week 14


<img src= "To Do app.jpg" width='300'/>
 
#### Installation:
 
You can copy the files into the same folder on your device. You need to be set up to run React on a local server. If you are, open the folder in VS Code. Then, you can type "http-server -c-1" in your VS Code terminal. Then, you type http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
 
#### Usage:
 
Adding tasks to your "To Do List" and checking them off.
 
#### Support: 
 
It doesn't really do enough to need support yet.
 
#### Roadmap: 
I had plans of adding check marks and being able to sort by complete and incomplete, but just centering the list and header took me a long time. Surprisingly to me adding the image didnâ€™t take that long.
